# This example IPS sensor takes advantage of the different severity levels and applies corresponding actions.
# Attackers who attempt Critical severity exploits will have their IP address banned for 1 day.
# Attackers who attempt High severity exploits will have their IP address banned for 1 hour.
# Attackers who attempt Medium severity exploits will have their exploit blocked, but will not have their IP address banned.
# Attackers who attempt Low severity exploits will have the default FortiGuard action applied (sometimes block, sometimes pass).
# Attackers who attempt Info severity exploits will only be monitored.
